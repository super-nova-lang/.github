# Welcome to Nova!

Nova is a programming language designed to bridge the gap between **functional programming** and **C-like systems languages**. Our goal is to make functional paradigms accessible to developers familiar with the syntax of Rust, Zig, C, and C++.

### What is Nova?

Nova combines the robust type systems and power of languages like **OCaml** and **Haskell** with the familiar, imperative structure of modern systems languages.

### Key Features

* **Friendly Syntax**: Inspired by the C-family to ensure a shallow learning curve.
* **Functional Roots**: Deeply influenced by OCaml's functional patterns.
* **Flexible Memory Management**: A garbage-collected language that offers optional explicit control over allocations.
* **Modern Tooling**: The `novac` compiler is built with OCaml and Dune for high-performance compilation.

### The Project

The project currently features a functional compiler (`novac`) with:

* **Lexer & Parser**: Full implementation for Nova source files.
* **AST Definitions**: Detailed Abstract Syntax Tree nodes for declarations, expressions, and statements.
* **Example Suite**: Check out our examples for currying, complex types, and more in the repository.
